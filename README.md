This notebook is a simple illustration for a regression model using "NSL-KDD" data set
 I have not explored the data thoroughly as it is already done on https://www.kaggle.com/code/timgoodfellow/nsl-kdd-explorations
 I have used RandomForestClassifier algorithm to follow the predictions but the model predictions can be enhanced by other algorithms by experimentations.
 This model shows some potentials of overfitting but we will do it next time with other algorithms.
